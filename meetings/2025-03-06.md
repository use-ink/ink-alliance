# Meeting on Feb 19, 2025

## Updates

Please paste info below for people to read up on before meeting.

### Michi
- Still working heavily on getting to our alpha release. Last days were exclusively spent debugging and fixing issues caused by third parties (rustc, rustup, GitHub runners no space left on device, â€¦).
- I've upgraded `cargo-contract` to `polkadot-sdk` from Feb 28. Still todos left and a lot of things that should be made prettier. But the tests run and it can be used.
- `substrate-contracts-node` is also synced with `polkadot-sdk` from Feb 28.
- `docker-images` is synced as well. The `eth-rpc` and `revive` in there are also up to date.
- Parity merged a first pre-compile that replaces the `ecdsa_recover` host function ([#7652](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7652)). I implemented it on the ink! side in [#2414](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2414). The API for ink! users stays the same, we just under the hood map to a pre-compile call.
- Parity changed how `H160` contract addresses are derived from an `AccountId`. I implemented it in `cargo-contract` and ink!.
- I'm having issues working around https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/7789. It gets extremely ugly, as we have to add `[patch]` sections to a number of crates + a direct dependency on `sp-runtime-interface` to enable the feature `disable_target_static_asserts`. I had this working, but this setup breaks regularly. So for now I changed all `polkadot-sdk` dependencies in `ink` to the [`polkadot-sdk/cmichi-disable-asserts`](https://github.com/use-ink/polkadot-sdk/tree/cmichi-disable-asserts) fork.
- Immediate ToDos:
  - `cargo-contract`: Write changelog. Talk to Alex Bean about how to adapt `pop-cli`.
  - Consolidate David's, Peter's, and my PRs for `ink`.
