# Meeting on June 11, 2025

## Updates

Please paste info below for people to read up on before the meeting.

### Michi
- Catching up on everything, syncing with David, Dann, Alex, Peter. Reading up on Parity PRs to revive and new revive GitHub issues.
- Working on size comparisons of contracts with ink! ABI vs. Solidity ABI.

### David
- Working on improving Solidity ABI support (and in general multiple ABI support i.e. "all" ABI) in `codegen`, `ink_env` and `ink_e2e`
  - Mainly targeted at trait definitions codegen, related generated call and message builders, and related utilities in `ink`, `ink_env` and `ink_e2e`
  - Draft PR at https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2517
  - Related issues:
    - This will leave handling Solidity ABI encoded constructor dispatch as the last remaining codegen issue ([see details](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2518)) for the Solidity ABI support (this PR is already quite big, so I didn't want to include it as well)
    - Another related issue (although not codegen specific) is leveraging the declared ABI for conditional compilation of ink! core crates for compile time and binary size improvements/optimizations ([see details](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2519))
- Next issues:
  - Adding user-defined errors to ink! ABI and metadata spec ([see details](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2404)), this should allow us to map user-defined errors in ink! to [custom Solidity errors](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#custom-errors), allowing messages with Result type in the return position to retain Solidity ABI compatibility
  - Providing a `Derive` macro for implementing `SolEncode` and `SolDecode` for arbitrary types ([see issue](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2462))
  - Adding compile-time check that prevents ink! messages with a `&self` receiver from mutating state via `ink_env` ([see details]([https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2462](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2405)))
    - This requires some compiler-based semantic analysis, and can inform other safety and ergonomics related improvements
- Other considerations:
  - Creating issues and documentating opportunities for compilation/build time and contract size improvements
    - Created an issue e2e build times (see https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2520)
    - Aforementioned issue for ABI based conditional compilation of ink! core crates also belongs in this category (see https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2519)
    - Will create more issue related to `codegen` (for contract size) and `cargo-contract` (for build time)
  - More powerful trait definitions allowing for abstractions for "shared behaviour/properties" that are more competitive with other languages

### Alex
- Changes to PolkadotJS to support ink! v6 have been merged, and a new version of `api-contracts` has been released: https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/issues/6149
  - Frontend tooling is nearly complete—only one project remains https://github.com/use-ink/ink-alliance/issues/58
- Upgraded `ink-node` to incorporate the latest changes in `pallet-revive`; some fixes are still pending.
- To be worked on following this call:
  - Explore using EVM frontend tooling with an ink! contract: https://github.com/use-ink/ink-alliance/issues/48
  - Analytics for ink-docs: https://github.com/use-ink/ink-docs/issues/417

## Agenda
- Michi: Up for discussion – Should we default to `ink_abi = sol`?
- Michi: What is missing for the current treasury proposal to be completed? Can someone create a list of all remaining todo's? I'm up for recording a couple educational ink! 101 videos that we can put on the YouTube channel, I believe that's one of the missing things.
- Michi: Analytics for use.ink

## Action Items from last Meeting
- ✅ List use.ink webpage into docusaurus showcase sites. ([PR](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/7826#discussioncomment-13169028))
- CI: add columns for comparisons in terms of contract size with solidity contracts.
- Reach out to Alex regarding Hub, precompiles, xcm
  - Also say that etherscan will have to use cargo contract.
- Salary payment
- Treasury strategy
- See if we can remove revive dependencies from the ink crate
- Improvements to drink: RFP
