# Meeting on May 14, 2025

## Updates

Please paste info below for people to read up on before the meeting.

### Michi
- On leave ❤️

### Alex
- Deployment of certain contracts on Westend Asset Hub is blocked due to the `unstable-hostfn` feature: https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2505
- In ongoing discussions with UI tooling teams (PAPI, Dedot and ink!athon) to support ink! v6: https://github.com/use-ink/ink-alliance/issues/58

### David
- Crate-level ABI declaration ([see details](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2479))
  - `cargo-contract` 
    - ✅ Main [PR](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/2033) is merged
    - Followup [PR](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/2034) is waiting for a review (adds a `cargo contract test` subcommand) 
  - `ink` codegen [PR](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2501) is still a draft because it needs above open `cargo contract` PR to be merged and the CI image to be updated to use the latest `cargo contract`. Other than that, its complete.
- Working on updating Solidity metadata generation in `cargo-contract` to properly support `SolEncode` and `SolDecode` implementing arbitrary types ([see here](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/issues/1996))
  - The `ink` codegen side of this is dependent on ABI declaration stuff above being merged.
- Next: Adding user-defined errors to ink! ABI and metadata spec (will alllow ink! messages with `Result` types in return position to maintain Solidity ABI compatibility) ([see details](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2404))

## Agenda

## Action Items from last Meeting

## Action Items
- Alex: retake Contracts UI to support ink! v6: https://github.com/use-ink/contracts-ui/pull/569

## Notes
- Daniel introduced `wink!` as a potential way to make `ink!` relevant for writing programs and services for JAM. If the ink! alliance is interested, Virto is open to exploring this direction. So far, the feedback has been positive.
- Pablo is working on a project using ink! v5 contracts and is preparing to start experimenting with ink! v6.
