### Michi
- Merged:
  - `polkadot-sdk`: [[pallet-revive] Migrate various getters to `System` pre-compile](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9517)
  - `polkadot-sdk`: [[pallet-revive] Properly convert `Ext::minimum_balance` value to `U256`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9705)
  - ink! + `cargo-contract` + `ink-docs`:
    - Did the 6.0.0-alpha.3 releases
    - Synced `ink-examples` with our latest release
    - Migrated a number of ink! functions to use the new `pallet-revive` `Storage` + `System` precompiles (https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2619). This allowed us to remove the "unstable" feature from a lot of ink! functionality.
    - E2E: Various improvements to the API, resolving todo comments, fixing smaller issues (https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2634)
    - Display more information when contract calls error (https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2636, https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/2133)
    - Removed call runtime + chain extensions everywhere (also in the docs)
    - Removed a bunch of dependency hotfixes we had that were no longer needed (https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/2633)
    - Upgraded a bunch of deps (https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/2127, https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/2132)
    - Make sure `cargo-contract` will work with the upcoming Rust 1.91 (https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/2131)
- In progress:
  - More `polkadot-sdk` PRs around precompiles (storage functions, sr25519, edcsa).
  - ink! CI: When syncing our `integration-tests` with `ink-examples` I found that some contracts failed building. Our `ink` CI did not recognize that, I've debugged it and have a PR upcoming.
  - Remove off-chain testing env.
  - Investigate a jump in contract sizes we had last week.
