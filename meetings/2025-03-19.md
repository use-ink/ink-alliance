### Michi

### Peter

### David
- I'm mainly working on more robust/simpler abstractions/interfaces for mapping Rust types to Solidity ABI compatible types. The motivation/goals/design are now documented as issues [here](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2429) and [here](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/2428).
- Also have a TODO for documenting `#[ink::contract(abi = "<ink|sol|all>")]`, including creating a table for default/provided Rust to Solidity type mappings.

### Ale
- ink!hub status update: We are still waiting for AZ to initiate the trasnfer. A reminder has been sent.
