### Ale
- Working on a new release for PAssetHub based on Michi's work: https://github.com/use-ink/polkadot-sdk/tree/pallet-revive-with-system-and-storage-precompiles
- - ETA for release as soon as ink! and the new runtime are ready :+1:

### Michi
- Still working on pre-compiles
 - Created this PR since last time: [Migrate unstable storage host functions to `Storage` pre-compile](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9603)
 - [Migrate various getters to System pre-compile](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9517) is still in review
 - Got [a branch](https://github.com/use-ink/polkadot-sdk/tree/cmichi-migrate-ecdsa-to-pre-compile) for more pre-compile migrations, but will only create the Polkadot SDK PR once they've merged the others.
 - Got [a branch](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/tree/cmichi-precompile-support-sep-2) for integrating the pre-compiles into `ink` and thus making a lot of `unstable-hostfns` stable.
 - Made [a branch](https://github.com/use-ink/polkadot-sdk/tree/pallet-revive-with-system-and-storage-precompiles) in `use-ink/polakdot-sdk` that contains my pre-compile work on `polkadot-sdk/master`.
   - Updated `cargo-contract`, `ink-node`, `docker-images` to use that branch.
- Published a `cargo-contract` 6.0.0-alpha.2
- Some minor work in `ink` and `cargo-contract`
  - Made `NativeToEthRatio` a part of our `Environment` and added conversion functions.
- In progress besides pre-compiles:
  - Removing chain extensions and "call into the runtime from ink!" ([branch](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/tree/cmichi-remove-call-runtime))
  - Solving a bunch of todo's + some refactorings  ([branch](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/tree/cmichi-cleanups-aug-29))

### Rich
- [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KmlQetGTcF64ICuT64c2agnqh2Gd0Vn-Q5rZChL9U-A/edit?tab=t.0) almost ready to provide to Parity for review. Open question as to whether an additional Curator is required 

## Agenda
- David: Multi ABI interface design
- David: Metadata generation options for multi ABI mode
- David: Using unstable ["specialization" feature](https://std-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/policy/specialization.html) in `ink_primitives`
- David: Unacknowledged costs/drawbacks of Sandboxed E2E
- Michi: Everyone should hand in their hours for July + August
- Michi: I'll be ooo from Sep 28 - Oct 11; will be on a trekking tour and without Internet during that time.
