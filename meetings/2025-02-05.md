# Meeting 5 Feb

## Agenda
- Updates  (please paste info below for people to read up on before meeting)
  - Michi:
    - The `master` of ink! + `cargo-contract` is now compatible with `pallet-revive` + `polkadot-sdk` from Jan 7. See [#1910](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/1910) for more details.
    - I'm now working on removing the off-chain testing environment in ink! (so `#[ink::test]`. Instead I want to put `drink` behind a nicer API. The current off-chain testing env is just a simulation of `pallet-revive`, whereas `drink` actually executes the `pallet-revive` code.
    - Subsequent tasks for me:
      - Assemble `ink-docs` migration guide
      - Follow-up on latests `pallet-revive` changes (removal of debug functionality, removal of events)
  - Effects on launch on Kusama
    - Pre-compiles have not been merged in `pallet-revive` and they are unlikely to land in Feb.
- Michi: I suggest doing a `cargo-contract` + ink! v6.0.0-alpha release after these are merged:
    - ink!: Removal off-chain testing env (Michi)
    - ink!: RLP support (Peter)
    - `cargo-contract`: Generate Solidity metadata (David)
- Audit ink! v6
- Boot strap bounties. Should we use issues, file in ink alliance repo?
  - ink! website upgrade
  - tutorials
  - content
- What do we do about Contracts UI?
