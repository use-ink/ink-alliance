# Bounty: ink! Documentation Website Upgrade

### Objective

The current ink! documentation website (https://use.ink/) is an extensive developer documentation. We want to move this content under `use.ink/docs` and have an engaging website in its place that provides a less overwhelming entry point to ink!.. 

The website should:
- Give a clear understanding of what ink! is and what its strengths are.
- Explain how it fits into the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Make further content easily discoverable (tutorials, developer documentation, contract examples, …).

There are already a lot of ink! illustrations in place. We also have a design identity that should be adhered to (see below). The person who did these illustrations can provide further design elements if desired.

### Project Completion Target

The website should be live at the end of March 2025.

## Scope of Work

### Website Structure

#### Home 
As an inspiration: we like how [https://cosmwasm.com/](https://cosmwasm.com/) is set up.
1. Hero Section
- Tagline: "Building Web3 applications using Rust"
- Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: 
  - `Get Started` → `Build`
  - `Join the Community` -> `Support`
- Links to key sections (top right):
    - `Build`: `Documentation`, `Tutorials`, `Tooling`
    - `Community`: `About`, `Bounties`, `Hackathons`, `Support`
    - `ink!ubator` (Funding)
    - `Ecosystem` (Chains focusing on ink! and applications build with ink!)
    
2. Key Features Section (Why ink!)
You can find some of the key features + icons on the [current landing page](https://use.ink/#our-pitch).
These include:
  - Security → Safe Rust-based smart contracts. Inherent safety-guarantees with the Rust programming language.
  - Rust → Ability to use all the normal Rust tooling ‒ clippy, crates.io, IDE’s, etc.
  - Interoperability with Solidity contracts.
  - Efficiency → Lightweight & gas-efficient execution. 
  - Modularity → Reusable contract components.  
  - Native to Polkadot.
  - Interoperability → Built for Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate chains.

#### Build (/build)

A central hub for developers.
- Documentation: redirects to [the current ink! documentation](https://use.ink/) (which will be placed under `/docs`).
  - Some elements from the current docs will be moved to the website you are setting up. The docs should solely focus on documentation and give those other elements a more suitable place (i.e. Funding Programs, Third Party Tools & Libraries, and perhaps more).
- Tutorials: hands-on guides, categorized if needed.
  - A "Propose a Tutorial" button (links to proposing a bounty but with the `Educational Resource` tag)
- Tooling, libraries and Integrations:
  - Frontend development: You can reuse content from https://use.ink/6.x/frontend/overview. But please slim it down, it should be less complex and intimidating.
  - Deploy and interact with your smart contract:
    - CLI: https://learn.onpop.io/contracts
    - Contracts UI: https://ui.use.ink/
  - Start, Build and Test your smart contract:
    - CLI: https://learn.onpop.io/contracts
  - IDE: https://github.com/ink-analyzer
  - …
- Chains: chains to deploy ink! smart contracts, with their icon directing to their website.
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ink-lang

#### Community (/community)

A space for engagement and contributions.

- About: https://cosmwasm.com/about
- Bounties: A list of approved bounties 
  - A “Propose a Bounty” button (links to a bounty proposal template).
- Hackathons: A page for upcoming hackathons and community events.
- Support: Community Links:
  - Telegram: Join the Community.
  - GitHub and other relevant links.
- Success stories: Applications built with ink! with their icon directing to their website.

 
#### ink!ubator (/inkubator)

A dedicated page for funding work that benefits the ink! ecosystem.
