# Bounty: ink! Documentation Website Upgrade

### Objective

The current ink! documentation website (https://use.ink/) is an extensive developer documentation. We want to move this content under `use.ink/docs` and have an engaging website in its place that provides a less overwhelming entry point to ink!.. 

The website should:
- Give a clear understanding of what ink! is and what its strengths are.
- Explain how it fits into the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Make further content easily discoverable (tutorials, developer documentation, contract examples, …).

There are already a lot of ink! illustrations in place. We also have a design identity that should be adhered to (see below). The person who did these illustrations can provide further design elements if desired.

### Project Completion Target

The website should be live at the end of March 2025.

## Scope of Work

### Website Structure

#### Home 
As an inspiration: we like how [https://cosmwasm.com/](https://cosmwasm.com/) is set up.
1. Hero Section
- Tagline: "Building Web3 applications using Rust"
- Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: 
  - `Get Started` → `Build`
  - `Join the Community` -> `Support`
- Links to key sections (top right):
    - `Build`: `Documentation`, `Tutorials`, `Tooling`
    - `Community`: `About`, `Bounties`, `Hackathons`, `Support`
    - `Inkubator` (Funding)
    - `Ecosystem` (Chains focusing on ink! and applications build with ink!)

2. Key Features Section (Why Ink!)
  - Security → Safe Rust-based smart contracts. 
  - Efficiency → Lightweight & gas-efficient execution. 
  - Modularity → Reusable contract components. 
  - Interoperability → Built for Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate chains.

Perhaps supported with a small icon to reinforce visual clarity.

#### Build (/build)

A central hub for developers.

- Documentation: redirects to the current ink! docs Github Pages.
  - Some elements will be moved to make it solely focused on docs and give those other elements a more suitable place (i.e. Funding Programs, Third Party Tools & Libraries, and perhaps more).-
- Tutorials: hands-on guides, categorized if needed.
  - A "Propose a Tutorial" button (links to proposing a bounty but with the `Educational Resource` tag)
- Tooling, libraries and Integrations: tools, libraries, and third-party integrations.
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ink-lang

#### Community (/community)

A space for engagement and contributions.

- About: https://cosmwasm.com/about
- Bounties: A list of approved bounties 
  - A “Propose a Bounty” button (links to a bounty proposal template).
- Hackathons: A page for upcoming hackathons and community events.
- Support: Community Links:
  - Telegram: Join the Community.
  - GitHub and other relevant links.
 
#### Inkubator (/inkubator)

A dedicated page for funding.

#### Ecosystem

Chains focusing on ink! with their icon directing to their website.
Applications built with ink! with their icon directing to their website.

### Technical Requirements
