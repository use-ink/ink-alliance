# ink! Alliance
Welcome to the ink! Alliance – a collective initiative to grow, maintain, and evangelize the ink! smart contract language across Polkadot.

The ink! Alliance meets bi-weekly to plan development priorities, explore product improvements, and manage community projects—such as developing the new ink! website ([more info](.//bounties/001-website_upgrade.md)). Meeting notes are publicly recorded in [this repository](./meetings). 

To manage intellectual property, the Alliance established Use Ink Ltd. in the UK. Much of the funding comes from the Polkadot Treasury, and the [proposals](./proposals) are fully transparent. Once approved, treasury funds are transferred to a multisig wallet, maintained by four curators (requiring 3 approvals):
- https://github.com/cmichi – Former ink! lead at Parity
- R0GUE – Team behind [Pop](https://onpop.io/)
- Polytope Labs – Team behind [Hyperbridge](https://hyperbridge.network/)
- Virto – Team behind [Virto](https://virto.network/en/)

## Mission
The ink! Alliance exists to make smart contract development on Polkadot easy, secure, and scalable by:
- Maintaining the ink! language and associated tooling
- Educating and onboarding developers to build with ink!
- Expanding ink! adoption across parachains and developer communities
- Unifying the branding, messaging, and experience around ink!
